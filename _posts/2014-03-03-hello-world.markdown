Hey, there. Do you like tacos? I like tacos. I also like tinkering with things I only have half a clue about, keeping my head in the clouds, and making stuff. I tend to have my hand in far-too-many interests but I&rsquo;ve decided it&rsquo;s futile to attempt to make any sense of and maintain them as separate entities. Instead, I&rsquo;m just going to create and publish, create and publish, create and publish, and see where it all takes me. Let&rsquo;s just see how ungracefully I can accomplish this.

Woah, I just made a [link][home]. (This is me learning this flavor of markdown.)
